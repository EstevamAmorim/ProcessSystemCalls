# The Story
<pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      Long ago there was a very powerful king. 
       
      King: I have dedicated my life to taking care of my kingdom, however I am dying    
            and it is time for me to advise you, my son, who will take the throne in my 
            place.                                                                       
         
      King: Son, take care of my kingdom as I did, don't seek riches at the expense of   
            people's suffering and don't let your ego cause wars.                        
        
      Son:  I will follow your advice my father, but I discovered that the country to    
            the north intends to take advantage of the instability caused by your death  
            and intends to attack, what should I do?                                     
       
      King: The North intends to attack? Damm!                                                                 
            The king of there has no support from his own population because he gets     
            involved in many wars for no reason which makes your respect low, naturally  
            your dynasty will not prevail, just expel your army from here, naturally     
            your power will collapse after this defeat.                                  
         
      After the father's death, the son now has the responsibility to become king. 
         
      The new King heads north to contain the impending attack. 
        
      Because he is very intelligent, he takes advantage of the fact that his face is    
      unknown to enemy commanders and he, after capturing one of his generals, makes him    
      a proposal...                                                                      
       
      New King: You, great general, can die here or be used as a clone of me, you will   
      wear royal clothes and two squads will protect your location, when your countrys   
      army finds out the truth you will be free.                                         
          
      Enemy General: All right, I accept your proposal. 
         
      New King: Your answer was as I imagined, you would inevitably choose that.    
       
      The King of the country to the north leads several battles, always trying to reach         
      the center of his enemys army, because he believes that the new king would be      
      there.                                                                             
       
      However, when he discovers the truth, his anger is so great that he has his own    
      general beheaded for fear of being betrayed...                                     
       
      Enemy General: Please spare my life!!!  
          
      King from North: Never!!! 
        
      In this way the general was killed by whom he had served all his life...
        
      This act further weakens the morale of the proud and incompetent king and his      
      warriors, weakening their fighting strength enormously. This act definitively      
      condemned that king.

      After five days, the inevitable happens, the young king expels his enemies and        
      returns to his capital, where he begins a fruitful lineage and for his character            
      a long time of peace begins, later he annexes the country to the north to his              
      kingdom and succeeds. huge popular support, for being very fair and compassionate,         
      as his father advised him.                                                                
       
      After a long reign, the king dies of natural causes.
